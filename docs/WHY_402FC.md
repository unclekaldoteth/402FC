# Why 402FC Exists

Last updated: February 14, 2026

## 1) Background

I grew up in Indonesia, where football is part of daily life. Fans are deeply loyal to their clubs and do not want to miss a single match.

Many supporters only care about selected fixtures, but the current market often forces them into full monthly subscriptions. When life gets busy and they miss games, they still pay the full price. This creates frustration and pushes some fans toward illegal streaming.

## 2) Problem

The current access model is mismatched with fan behavior:

1. Fans pay for a full month even if they only watch one or two matches.
2. Urgent schedules and real-life constraints reduce watch time, so value feels wasted.
3. Price friction and poor flexibility increase piracy risk.
4. Clubs and rights holders lose potential revenue from casual or price-sensitive fans who would pay if match-level access existed.

## 3) Solution

402FC introduces a pay-per-watch model:

1. Fans pay only for the match or content they want.
2. Payments happen instantly using x402 + STX micropayments.
3. No forced subscription lock-in.
4. Premium content (stream session, highlights, analytics, AI insights) unlocks per request.

Core idea: convert "I do not want a monthly plan" users into legal paying users through low-friction, event-based pricing.

## 4) Why This Matters

402FC aligns pricing with real fan behavior:

1. Die-hard club fans get control and flexibility.
2. Casual viewers can pay for key matches without commitment.
3. Clubs and organizers can monetize high-intent demand that subscriptions miss.

## 5) Potential Market Opportunity (Illustrative for MVP Planning)

This section is a planning model, not a final forecast.

### Indonesia Beachhead Model

1. TAM (digital football viewers): large national audience with strong football interest.
2. SAM (fans who prefer occasional pay-per-event access): users who resist monthly bundles but will pay for selected matches.
3. SOM (12-month target): initial conversion from SAM through one-league launch and focused fan communities.

### Example Scenario Ranges

1. Early paid user capture: 0.2% to 0.8% of reachable SAM.
2. Average paid events per user per month: 1 to 3.
3. Ticket size: micro-pricing per event (aligned with local affordability and rights economics).

Even conservative conversion can create meaningful legal revenue because:

1. The addressable segment is large.
2. Payment friction is low.
3. Purchase intent is tied to specific high-emotion events.

## 6) Potential Benefits for Clubs, Leagues, and Organizers

1. Incremental revenue from fans who reject subscriptions but will pay per match.
2. Better monetization of long-tail fixtures, not only marquee games.
3. Lower piracy pressure by offering a fair legal option.
4. Better fan data on match-level demand, willingness to pay, and club-specific behavior.
5. Flexible packaging options: single match pass, derby pass, club-only mini bundles, plus replay and analytics add-ons.
6. Faster experimentation with pricing, promotions, and sponsor-backed unlocks.

## 7) Potential Benefits for Fans

1. Pay only when they watch.
2. Lower financial commitment.
3. More transparent value per purchase.
4. Better experience than searching for illegal streams.

## 8) Hackathon MVP Positioning

Current 402FC MVP proves the core mechanics:

1. Wallet connection.
2. HTTP 402 preflight challenge.
3. Paid retry and unlock flow.
4. Session-based content access model.

This validates the payment and entitlement rails required for future licensed streaming expansion.

## 9) Expansion Logic (Post-MVP)

1. Start with one competition and one pilot territory.
2. Prove conversion, playback success, and legal demand capture.
3. Expand territory by territory based on rights availability and compliance.
4. Add prediction products and deeper club intelligence as paid modules.

## 10) Success Metrics

1. Payment-to-playback success rate.
2. Paid conversion from preflight to completed unlock.
3. Repeat purchase rate per user.
4. Piracy substitution signal (users choosing legal pay-per-watch over illegal streams).
5. Net revenue per rights window.

## 11) One-Sentence Thesis

402FC makes football access fairer and more efficient by turning subscription-frustrated fans into legal pay-per-watch users, while creating new incremental revenue for clubs and organizers.
